            <p>Experience the excitement of the T-Rex Game, where you control a running dinosaur that faces the challenge of dodging cacti on its path. As you guide the T-Rex, the game's speed gradually increases, putting your reflexes to the test. Be cautious â€“ a collision with any cactus ends the game. But don't worry, a replay button appears, inviting you to take on the challenge again and beat your high score. Get ready to run, jump, and set new records in this classic and addictive browser-based game.</p>

            <p>The Birthday Wisher Chrome Extension revolutionizes how we engage with Facebook birthdays. Seamlessly bridging connections, it facilitates timely birthday wishes, upcoming reminders, and personalized messages, seamlessly bringing meaningful interactions to our busy digital lives. With user-centric design at its core, this extension elevates online celebrations, ensuring no special moment slips by unnoticed.

              At the heart of this innovation is the "Archive Chat" feature, a standout addition showcasing my commitment to user convenience. Messages for upcoming, follow-up, and current birthdays gracefully archive after a short 10-second interval, creating an organized and clutter-free chat environment. Additionally, the extension empowers users to effortlessly post heartfelt messages on friends' timelines and send thoughtful greetings via Messenger chat. The Birthday Wisher Chrome Extension embodies my JavaScript and Chrome extension expertise, transforming everyday gestures into powerful connections and contributing to a more connected digital world.
